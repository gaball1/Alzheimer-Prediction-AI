# Alzheimer Prediction  

## Overview  
**Alzheimer Prediction** is a machine learning-based project that predicts the likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease based on clinical and imaging data. The project is implemented with an interactive and user-friendly web application built using **Streamlit**. This tool aims to facilitate early detection and awareness of Alzheimer’s, contributing to better healthcare outcomes.  

## Features  
### 1. **Home Page**  
- Overview of the project and its importance in addressing Alzheimer’s challenges.  

### 2. **Prediction Page**  
- Users can input clinical data and MRI findings.  
- Predicts the likelihood of Alzheimer’s using robust machine learning models.  

### 3. **Visualization Page**  
- Interactive visualizations for exploring data relationships and model results.
